What are the types of Docker Networks?

Bridge Network:
	Default network when you run a container without specifying any network. Containers can communicate with each other if they’re on the same bridge network.

Host Network:
	The container shares the host's network stack and doesn't get its own IP. Typically used when you want very high network performance or if you want to bypass NAT.

Overlay Network:
	Used to connect containers across different Docker hosts, commonly used in Docker Swarm.

Macvlan Network:
	Assigns a MAC address to each container, making it appear as a physical device on the network. This is used when you need direct integration with the network.

None:
	Disables networking entirely. This is useful for security reasons if the container doesn’t need any networking.
